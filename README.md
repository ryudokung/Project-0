# Project-0: Tactical Noir AI-Powered Web Game

Project-0 is a high-stakes, 1:1 scale Sci-Fi Exploration and Combat game on **Base L2**. It features a hybrid economy and AI-driven innovation, where players operate modular vehicles in an intense, evolving universe.

## 🌌 The Vision: "Tactical Noir"
Project-0 is not just a game; it's an evolving universe. Players take on the role of **Operatives** in a dark, industrial future where every mission is a chapter in a gripping narrative. The core focus is on **Social Prestige**, **Collection Pride**, and **High-Stakes Survival**.

## 🚀 Core Gameplay Loop (MVP1 Focus)
1.  **The Cold Start:** Wake up in the void, float to your derelict Mothership, and repair the Radar using salvaged Scrap.
2.  **The Radar (Discovery):** Scan for "Blips" (Nodes) and click to explore new locations in the star system.
3.  **The Hangar (Inventory):** View and manage your unique vehicles (Mechs, Speeders, Exosuits, Tanks, Ships, Haulers).
4.  **The Action (Deployment):** Select the best-fit vehicle for each mission's specific requirements (Atmosphere, Stealth, Heavy Combat).
5.  **The Salvage (Economy):** Refine scrap, research blueprints, and choose when to **Mint to Chain (V2O)**.

## 🚜 Vehicle Archetypes
- **Mechs:** Balanced bipedal combat units. All-terrain capability.
- **Tanks:** Heavy-armored siege units. High defense, low speed.
- **Ships:** High-speed aerial scouts. Required for space-to-surface interception.
- **Speeders:** Hoverbikes for high-velocity scouting and stealth.
- **Exosuits:** Power armor for indoor salvage and boarding actions.
- **Heavy Haulers:** Industrial units for bulk transport and massive salvage.
- **Pilot (EVA):** The operative themselves. High risk, but required for precision salvage in tight spaces.

## ✨ Unique Selling Points

- **Node-Based Exploration:** A "Tactical Noir" radar interface where you click to discover the universe.
