# Creator Studio Bible: Project-0 (The God Mode)

**Goal:** Define the tools and workflows for the Creator to manage the evolving universe, AI generation, and player economy.

## 1. Context Patching (The Narrative Engine)
The universe evolves through "Context Patches" deployed by the Creator.
- **Patch Types:**
    - **World Event:** A global change (e.g., "The Iron Syndicate has declared war").
    - **New Sector:** Unlocking a new star system with unique hazards and loot.
    - **Seasonal Drop:** Introducing a new set of AI-generated NFT parts.
- **Workflow:** Creator writes the "Core Narrative" -> AI Agents (Samus, Cloud) update the Bibles -> System generates new exploration encounters.

## 2. AI Prompt Engineering (Visual Consistency)
To ensure all AI-generated assets look like they belong to the same universe:
- **Master LoRA/Style:** A fixed visual foundation for each season.
- **Visual DNA Guardrails:**
    - **Material Enforcement:** Ensuring "Industrial Steel" always looks consistent across Vehicles.
    - **Faction Aesthetics:** Automatically applying "Void Cult" purple glows to any item associated with that faction.
- **Quality Control:** A "God Mode" dashboard to review and approve/regenerate key asset visuals.

## 3. Universe Analytics (The Eye of God)
Real-time monitoring of the player ecosystem:
- **Death Heatmaps:** Identifying zones that are too difficult or too easy.
- **Economy Health:** Monitoring the total supply of Scrap and Cores to prevent inflation.
- **Asset Popularity:** Seeing which NFT parts are being "Flexed" the most in the Bastion.

## 4. Live Operations (LiveOps)
- **Difficulty Adjustment:** Real-time tweaking of enemy stats or drop rates based on community progress.
- **Manual Events:** Triggering a "Pirate Raid" or "Solar Flare" manually to keep players engaged.
- **Hall of Fame Management:** Immortalizing top players in the game's metadata and lore.

## 5. The Creator Dashboard (UI)
A dedicated, secure interface for:
- **Drag-and-Drop Sector Creation.**
- **Narrative Entry Field (MCP-powered).**
- **Economy Kill-switch (in case of exploits).**
