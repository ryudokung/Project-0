# Product Brief: Project-0

**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Author:** Vatcharin

## 1. Product Vision & Problem Statement

### The Problem
Traditional Crypto games often suffer from extreme volatility and "FOMO" cycles. When a game becomes popular, the entry barrier for new players skyrockets as token prices inflate, making it expensive to start and risky for latecomers. This creates a "pay-to-play" barrier that stifles long-term growth and community health.

### The Solution (Project-0)
Project-0 introduces a sustainable economic model that blends traditional gaming mechanics with AI and Crypto. 
- **Accessible Entry:** Players can start for free, farming resources to progress rather than being forced to buy expensive tokens upfront.
- **Direct-to-System Economy:** The economy focuses on player-to-system interactions to stabilize value, while still allowing player-to-player trading for farmed resources.
- **AI-Driven Scarcity:** Leveraging AI to generate unique, seasonal NFT assets (Mechs, Tanks, Items) that are truly one-of-a-kind. Once a season ends, those specific AI-generated designs may never appear again, creating genuine aesthetic and functional rarity.

### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)
**"AI-Powered Seasonal Rarity & Hybrid Economy"**
- **Generative NFTs:** Every Mech, Tank, or Item is an AI-generated masterpiece with unique visual traits and randomized attributes ("Options").
- **Ownership & Prestige:** Players own "Keys" mapped to these unique assets, which can be showcased as NFTs or traded.
- **The "Star" Theme:** A vast, AI-augmented universe where exploration leads to unique discoveries and resource gathering.

### Success Definition
To be recognized as the definitive bridge between traditional gaming, AI innovation, and Crypto technology—a project that grows steadily and sustainably within the crypto gaming community.

## 2. Target Users & Personas

### Primary Segment: The Discord Socialites (The Catalysts)
These are the community leaders and active social media users who drive engagement. They are the first to react to alerts and the most vocal about their achievements.
- **Motivation:** Social prestige, community influence, and "First to Discover" status.
- **Role in Ecosystem:** They bring in the Grinders and Traders by showcasing rare finds and organizing raids.
- **Key Interaction:** Monitoring Discord for "New Planet" alerts, sharing Trophies, and facilitating trades in dedicated channels.

### Secondary Segment: The Grinders (The Foundation)
Players who enjoy the steady progress of character development and resource gathering.
- **Motivation:** Character growth, completing archives, and earning through effort.
- **Role in Ecosystem:** They provide the raw materials (Iron, Leather, etc.) needed for the economy to function.
- **Key Interaction:** Daily adventures, resource farming using different vehicles (Mechs/Tanks), and participating in raids.

### Tertiary Segment: The Collectors/Traders (The Value Seekers)
Players focused on the rarity and aesthetic value of AI-generated assets.
- **Motivation:** FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) on seasonal AI designs and finding "God-tier" attribute rolls.
- **Role in Ecosystem:** They provide liquidity and long-term value to the NFT assets.
- **Key Interaction:** Trading "Keys" for unique Mechs/Tanks and hunting for specific seasonal aesthetics.

## 3. User Journey: The "Star Explorer" Path
1. **Onboarding:** Create a free character -> Receive a unique (but basic) AI-generated avatar.
2. **Engagement:** Join Discord -> Set up alerts for new star discoveries.
3. **Progression:** Adventure on foot (basic resources) -> Save up/Farm for a Vehicle Key (Mech/Tank/Ship).
4. **Peak Experience:** Participate in a Raid Boss event discovered via Discord -> Earn a "Season-Exclusive" AI-generated Item/Vehicle.
5. **Retention:** Showcase the unique NFT on Discord -> Trade or upgrade for the next season.

## 4. Key Metrics & Success Indicators

### North Star Metric
- **Daily Active Players (DAP):** The primary indicator of game health and community engagement. Steady growth in DAP reflects a successful blend of traditional and crypto gaming.

### Secondary Metrics
- **Discord Conversion Rate:** Percentage of Discord members who actively participate in "New Planet" raids or trade in dedicated channels.
- **Seasonal NFT Adoption:** Tracking the percentage of active players who acquire at least one AI-generated seasonal NFT.
- **Resource Velocity:** Monitoring the flow of farmed resources (Iron, Leather, etc.) to ensure the "Direct-to-System" economy remains balanced.

### Security & Integrity Metrics
- **Bot Detection & Anomaly Monitoring:** Implementing metrics to track suspicious resource accumulation rates or repetitive interaction patterns to prevent bot abuse and economic collapse.
- **Multi-Account Correlation:** Monitoring for clusters of accounts with similar behavior to maintain a fair playing field for genuine users.

## 5. MVP Scope Definition

### Core Features (MVP)
- **Multi-Vehicle System:** Full implementation of Mechs, Tanks, and Spacecraft, each with distinct resource-gathering advantages.
- **Complex Combat Engine:** A sophisticated battle system that calculates outcomes based on character stats, vehicle attributes, and equipped AI-generated items.
