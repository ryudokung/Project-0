# Player Journey: Project-0 (From Rookie to Legend)

**Goal:** Define the long-term progression path, emotional milestones, and "Flex" points for the player.

## 1. Phase 1: The Rookie Operative (Early Game)
*Focus: Survival, Learning, and First Ownership.*

- **The Seamless Entry:** Player joins the universe instantly via Social Login. No wallet setup required to start the journey.
- **The Initial Hook:** Player wakes up in a cold, dark void, wearing only a basic **Pilot Exosuit** with limited O2. They are floating near their **Starter Vehicle**, which is currently in low-power mode.
- **Starter Quest: "Signal Lost":** The Bastion's Radar is malfunctioning. The player must perform a manual EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) to find Scrap from nearby debris to repair the Radar and unlock the mission board.
- **The Awakening:** The first official mission. The player uses their **Starter Vehicle** to navigate to a nearby derelict wreck.
- **The "Aha!" Moment:** Finding the first Rare NFT part and seeing the AI synthesize it onto their Vehicle in the Bastion.
- **Goal:** Repair the Bastion's core systems and build the first full-scale Mech or specialized Tank/Ship.
- **Emotional State:** Vulnerability, isolation, and the drive to survive.

## 2. Phase 2: The Skilled Mercenary (Mid Game)

## 3. Phase 3: The Elite Commander (End Game)
*Focus: Dominance, Legendary Collection, and Personal Legacy.*

- **Progression:** Player operates a fleet of 6+ high-tier vehicles, including **Heavy Haulers** and specialized **Infiltration Exosuits**.
- **Dominance:** Achieving high **Pilot Resonance** to "Annihilate" lower-tier threats and focus on high-stakes endgame content.
- **The Ultimate Goal:** Finding fragments of **The Singularity** and participating in world-changing "Context Patch" events.
- **The "Legend" Moment:** Completing the **"Captain's Log"**—a personal Hall of Fame that immortalizes the player's own first discoveries and greatest victories.

4. **Combat/Salvage:** Engage in tactical combat, use **Transformation** or **Infiltration**, and extract rare NFT components.
5. **Debrief & Showcase:** Return to the Bastion to synthesize new parts and share the "Flex" build.
