# Player Journey: Project-0 (From Rookie to Legend)

**Goal:** Define the long-term progression path, emotional milestones, and "Flex" points for the player.

## 1. Phase 1: The Rookie Operative (Early Game)
*Focus: Survival, Learning, and First Ownership.*

- **The Initial Hook:** Player wakes up in a cold, dark void, wearing only a basic **Pilot Spacesuit** with limited O2 and a standard-issue **Pistol**. They are floating near a small, nondescript **Mothership** that is powered down.
- **Starter Quest: "Signal Lost":** The Mothership's Radar is broken. The player must perform a manual EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) to find Scrap from nearby debris to repair the Radar and unlock the mission board.
- **The Awakening:** The first official mission. The player uses a basic **Exosuit** (not a full Mech yet) to enter a nearby derelict wreck.
- **The "Aha!" Moment:** Finding the first Rare NFT part and seeing the AI synthesize it onto their Exosuit or first Vehicle in the Hangar.
- **Goal:** Repair the Mothership's core systems and build the first full-scale Vehicle (Mech or Speeder).
- **Emotional State:** Vulnerability, isolation, and the drive to survive.

## 2. Phase 2: The Skilled Mercenary (Mid Game)
*Focus: Optimization, Versatility, and Risk Management.*

- **Progression:** Player unlocks **Tanks** and **Ships**. They start choosing missions based on the "Vehicle Archetype" needed.
- **Dynamic Style:** Player collects parts from different factions (e.g., an *Iron Syndicate* Chassis with *Void Cult* Weapons) to create a unique hybrid style.
- **The "Flex" Point:** Sharing a highly customized build that combines multiple faction aesthetics.
- **New Mechanic:** Unlocking **Quantum Teleportation** to bypass risky atmospheric entries.
- **Goal:** Reach the "Neon Abyss" and survive an Extreme-threat mission.
- **Emotional State:** Confidence and pride in their growing collection.

## 3. Phase 3: The Elite Commander (End Game)
*Focus: Dominance, Legendary Collection, and Personal Legacy.*

- **Progression:** Player operates a fleet of 6+ high-tier vehicles, including **Heavy Haulers** and **Exosuits**.
- **The Ultimate Goal:** Finding fragments of **The Singularity** and participating in world-changing "Context Patch" events.
- **The "Legend" Moment:** Completing the **"Captain's Log"**—a personal Hall of Fame that immortalizes the player's own first discoveries and greatest victories.
- **V2O Mastery:** Bridging a full squad of Legendary NFTs to the blockchain for high-value trading.
- **Goal:** Dominate the seasonal challenges and influence the universe's narrative.
- **Emotional State:** Personal satisfaction and a sense of legacy.

## 4. The "Operative" Daily Loop (Session Journey)
1. **Briefing:** Check the "Context Patch" for new world events.
2. **Maintenance:** Repair and refuel using Scrap from yesterday's run.
3. **Execution:** High-stakes mission (Combat or EVA).
4. **Salvage:** The thrill of the "Reveal" (What did I find?).
5. **Showcase:** Update the Hangar "Flex" build and share progress.

## 5. Emotional Milestones (The "Gasp" Moments)
- **The First Synthesis:** Seeing the AI combine mismatched parts into a cool, cohesive design.
- **The Near-Death Escape:** Successfully extracting from an EVA mission with 5% O2 left.
- **The Rare Drop:** Seeing the "Legendary Gold" glow during a salvage reveal.
- **Personal Discovery:** Being the first to reach a hidden zone within a sector for the first time in their own journey.
