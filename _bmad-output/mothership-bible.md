# Mothership Bible: Project-0 (The Command Center)

**Goal:** Define the progression, facilities, and deployment technologies of the player's mobile base.

## 1. Mothership Facilities (The Tech Tree)
The Mothership is the player's primary progression hub. Upgrading facilities unlocks new gameplay mechanics:

| Facility | Level 1 (Starter) | Level 5 (Advanced) | Level 10 (Elite) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hangar** | Basic Repairs (Slow) | Auto-Repair (Fast) | Modular Refit (Instant) |
| **Scanner/Radar** | **Broken (Requires Repair)** | Deep Scan (Sector) | Void Probe (Inter-Sector) |
| **Lab** | Basic Scrap Refining | Core Synthesis | Blueprint Overclocking |
| **Bridge** | Manual Navigation | AI Autopilot | Tactical Command (Fleet) |

## 2. Deployment Technologies (The "Entry" Choice)
How the player reaches the surface determines the risk and cost of the mission.

### 2.1 Atmospheric Entry (Standard)
- **Mechanic:** The vehicle is launched in a drop-pod or flies down manually.
- **Requirement:** Vehicle must have high **Heat Shielding** and **Armor**.
- **Risk:** High. Random "Entry Events" (Turbulence, AA Fire, Heat Damage).
- **Cost:** Low (Fuel only).

### 2.2 Quantum Teleportation (Advanced Upgrade)
- **Mechanic:** Instant deployment of the Pilot or a Light Vehicle (Speeder/Exosuit) to the surface.
- **Requirement:** Mothership Upgrade: **"Quantum Gate" (Level 8 Bridge)**.
- **Risk:** Zero (Bypasses the atmospheric entry phase).
- **Cost:** High (Requires "Core Fragments" or massive Energy consumption).
- **Limitation:** Cannot teleport Heavy Vehicles (Tanks/Heavy Mechs) until Level 10.

## 3. Mothership Customization (The "Flex")
The Mothership is also a social asset:
- **Visual DNA:** The hull reflects the player's chosen faction (e.g., Iron Syndicate rust vs. Void Cult obsidian).
- **Interior:** Customizable Bridge and Hangar for "Photo Mode."
- **Fleet:** As the Mothership levels up, it can carry more vehicles (from 1 to 6).

## 4. Resource Management (Click-Based)
- **Fuel:** Required for all travel and node transitions.
- **Energy:** Required for Scanning and Teleportation.
- **O2 Reserves:** Refills Pilot EVA tanks.
- **Radar Status:** If Radar is broken (Level 0), no mission nodes are visible. Repairing it is the first objective.
