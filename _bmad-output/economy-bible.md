# Economy & Tokenomics Bible: Project-0 (The Lifeblood)

**Goal:** Define the currency flows, NFT bridging logic, and monetization strategy to ensure a sustainable and high-value ecosystem.

## 1. The Dual-Currency System
- **Scrap (Soft Currency):** 
    - **Source:** Exploration, Salvaging common parts, Daily rewards.
    - **Use:** Repairs, **Radar Restoration**, Basic maintenance, Crafting common blueprints.
    - **Nature:** Off-chain (Web2 Database).
- **Cores (Premium Currency/Resource):**
    - **Source:** Season Pass, High-tier boss drops, Marketplace.
    - **Use:** "Overclocking" (Upgrading NFT stats), Minting to Chain.
    - **Nature:** On-chain (ERC-20 or high-value NFT).

## 2. Stage Change Model (Virtual-to-On-chain)
The core mechanic for asset ownership:
- **Lazy Minting:** All items start as "Virtual Assets" in the database.
- **Stage Change:** To trade an item on the marketplace or verify its rarity, the player must "Mint" it to the Base L2 blockchain.
- **Digital Twin:** The NFT remains fully functional in-game. It still follows the **Deep Durability System (DDS)** and requires repairs at The Bastion.
- **Cost:** Requires a "Minting Key" (purchasable or rare drop) and a small amount of Scrap.
- **Benefit:** Once on-chain, the item is a true NFT (ERC-721) with permanent metadata and visual DNA.

## 3. Monetization: The "Direct-to-System" Model
- **Season Pass (Standard):** Unlocks the seasonal narrative and basic rewards.
- **Season Pass+:** Unlocks exclusive Visual DNA traits, 2x Exploration Rate (capped), and "Founder" status.
- **No USDT Out:** The system does not provide a direct way to cash out to USDT. Value is maintained through **Asset Scarcity** and **Social Prestige**. Players trade with each other using the game's premium currency or Base ETH.

## 4. Salvage & Burn Mechanics
To prevent hyperinflation of items:
- **Deep Durability System (DDS):** Items lose durability through use and combat. Repairing costs Scrap and Energy. Items at "Broken" status provide 0 stats until repaired.
- **Scrapping:** Players can "Burn" unwanted NFTs to receive Scrap and a small chance for a "Core Fragment."
- **Seasonal Retirement:** Older seasonal items become "Legacy" assets. They can still be used but cannot be minted again, increasing their collector value.

## 5. Death & Recovery: The "Cloning" System
To balance high-stakes gameplay with asset security:
- **The Rule:** If a Pilot dies (during EVA or Vehicle destruction), the player **loses all loot gathered during that specific run**.
- **Asset Security:** Permanent NFTs (Vehicles and equipped Modules) are **never lost**. However, they take "Critical Damage" (DDS Threshold) and require significant Scrap to repair before they can be used again.
- **Cloning (Service):** This is a **consumable service**, not a permanent NFT. Players pay a small Scrap fee before a mission to "Sync" their consciousness. If they die, they are "re-sleeved" at The Bastion.
- **Insurance (Optional):** A one-time Scrap payment per mission that reduces the repair cost of the vehicle if it gets destroyed.

## 6. Early Game Economy (The "Radar" Gate)
- **Initial Goal:** The player starts with 0 Scrap and a broken Radar on The Bastion.
- **First Mission:** Must perform a manual EVA to find enough Scrap (e.g., 50 units) to repair the Radar.
- **Progression:** Once the Radar is repaired, the player can see more nodes and start earning Scrap more consistently.
