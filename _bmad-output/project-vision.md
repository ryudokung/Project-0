# Project-0 Vision: The Architect's Compass

**Goal:** To ensure the project remains focused on its core identity and doesn't "drift" during development.

## 1. The Narrative Pillar: "The Shattered Universe" (The Expedition)
- **The Setting:** 300 years after *The Great Collapse*. The universe is dark, silent, and isolated.
- **The Player Identity:** You are a **Void Scavenger**, a pilot with a rare neural resonance capable of linking with ancient tech.
- **The Starting Point:** You begin with a standard-issue **Resonance Suit** and a salvaged **Starter Vehicle**, provided by the Director (Loki) to navigate the first sector.
- **The Core Conflict:** Survival against the void and competing NPC factions (Iron Syndicate, Void Cult, Scavengers).
- **The Ultimate Goal:** Discovering fragments of **The Singularity** to restore interstellar travel.
- **The Director's Role (Loki):** You control the "Expeditions" (Context Patches), opening new sectors and events for players to explore.

## 2. The Reward Pillar: "Identity & Value" (The Encounters)
- **Visual Identity:** AI-generated **Visual DNA** (FLUX.1) ensures every vehicle is a 1-of-1 masterpiece.
- **Personal Legacy:** The **Captain's Log** records every "First Discovery" and "Near-Death Escape," creating a unique history for every player.
- **Tangible Value:** Assets can be bridged to **Base L2 (V2O)**, turning virtual achievements into real-world ownership.

## 3. The Utility Pillar: "The Evolution Loop" (The Loop)
1. **Scavenge:** High-stakes, node-based exploration to find Scrap and Blueprints.
2. **Synthesize:** Using AI to assemble modular parts into cohesive, high-fidelity 3D assets. Unlocked after the first mission.
3. **Upgrade:** Investing resources back into the Bastion (Radar, Lab, Bridge) to unlock harder "Expeditions."
4. **Bridge:** Moving high-tier assets to the blockchain for social prestige and trading.

## 4. The Seasonal Pillar: "Temporal Wormholes"
- **The Mechanic:** Every season, a massive **Temporal Wormhole** opens in a specific sector, staying active for the duration of the season.
- **Equipment Compatibility:** These wormholes are unstable and only support specific equipment types or "Resonance Levels." Players must craft or find compatible gear to enter.
- **Rare Loot:** Wormholes contain "Lost Tech" and "Rare DNA Fragments" that cannot be found anywhere else, driving the seasonal economy.
