# Project-0 Vision: The Architect's Compass

**Goal:** To ensure the project remains focused on its core identity and doesn't "drift" during development.

## 1. The Narrative Pillar: "The Shattered Universe" (The Expedition)
- **The Setting:** 300 years after *The Great Collapse*. The universe is dark, silent, and isolated.
- **The Core Conflict:** Survival against the void and competing NPC factions (Iron Syndicate, Void Cult, Scavengers).
- **The Ultimate Goal:** Discovering fragments of **The Singularity** to restore interstellar travel.
- **The Director's Role (Loki):** You control the "Expeditions" (Context Patches), opening new sectors and events for players to explore.

## 2. The Reward Pillar: "Identity & Value" (The Encounters)
- **Visual Identity:** AI-generated **Visual DNA** (FLUX.1) ensures every vehicle is a 1-of-1 masterpiece.
- **Personal Legacy:** The **Captain's Log** records every "First Discovery" and "Near-Death Escape," creating a unique history for every player.
- **Tangible Value:** Assets can be bridged to **Base L2 (V2O)**, turning virtual achievements into real-world ownership.

## 3. The Utility Pillar: "The Evolution Loop" (The Loop)
1. **Scavenge:** High-stakes, node-based exploration to find Scrap and Blueprints.
2. **Synthesize:** Using AI to assemble modular parts into cohesive, high-fidelity 3D assets.
3. **Upgrade:** Investing resources back into the Mothership (Radar, Lab, Bridge) to unlock harder "Timelines."
4. **Bridge:** Moving high-tier assets to the blockchain for social prestige and trading.
