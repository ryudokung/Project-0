# Project Context: Project-0

## Project Overview
Project-0 is a Crypto Web Game featuring AI-generated seasonal NFTs (Mechs, Tanks, Ships) on Base L2, with a hybrid economy and a "No USDT Out" revenue model.

### Core Gameplay Pillars
- **Adaptive Universe:** AI-driven ecosystem with evolving narratives and combat logs.
- **Modular NFT Assembly:** Every part (Railgun, Shield, Pilot Suit) is an individual NFT. AI dynamically synthesizes these parts into a single visual representation based on the player's loadout and mission context.
- **Colony Management:** Upgradeable home bases that can move between star systems.
- **AI Narrative Timeline (Expedition & Encounters):** 
    - **The Expedition:** The core narrative anchor or mission objective defined by the Director (e.g., "Repairing the Radar"). It provides the context and constraints for the AI.
    - **The Encounters:** Procedural sub-events and visual reveals generated by AI. These are "strung" onto the expedition based on player stats, choices, and environmental context.
    - **Visual DNA Synthesis:** AI dynamically combines Mech DNA, Weapon DNA, and Node Environment into a unique visual prompt for each "Encounter," ensuring every moment is personalized.
    - **Context-Aware Generation:** The AI ensures that all generated encounters remain consistent with the current "Expedition" (e.g., no space travel events while on a planetary repair mission).
- **Mothership:** Space travel & atmospheric entry.
- **Salvage & Research:** Capture enemy units to sell, research tech, or scrap for parts.
- **Story Mode:** Structured narrative providing fixed foundation items and tutorials.

## Technical Stack & Infrastructure
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Zustand.
- **Backend:** Go (Modular Monolith), Clean Architecture, Saga Pattern.
- **Blockchain:** Base L2, ERC-721, Privy/Dynamic (Auth).
- **AI:** FLUX.1 via Fal.ai/Replicate.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker & Docker Compose.

## Critical Implementation Rules
- **Saga Pattern:** All multi-step transactions (Assembly, Discovery) must use the Saga Pattern with idempotency keys.
- **Clean Architecture:** Go backend must follow Clean Architecture (Entities, Use Cases, Repository, Delivery).
- **Dockerized Environment:** All services must be runnable via `docker-compose up`.
- **AI Guardrails:** Use Structured Output (JSON Schema) and RAG to prevent hallucinations.
- **Housekeeping:** Temporary logs (Combat Logs) must be deleted after 7 days unless paid to save.

## Current Progress (Epic 3: Combat & Exploration Engine)
- [x] Backend Combat Engine (Damage Formulas, Status Effects)
- [x] Modular Mech Infrastructure (Parts, Stats, Nullable Fields)
- [x] Interactive TUI/CLI for Combat Testing
- [x] Expedition & Encounters Database Schema (Stars, Nodes, Sessions)
- [x] Visual DNA Aggregator (Mech + Environment Prompt Logic)
- [ ] Exploration UseCase (Node selection & Event handling)
- [ ] AI Image Generation Integration (FLUX.1)

## Directory Structure
- `/backend`: Go source code.
- `/frontend`: Next.js source code.
- `/_bmad-output`: Project documentation (PRD, Architecture).
- `/_bmad`: BMad Method configuration and agents.

## Development Workflow
1. Use `docker-compose up --build` to start the environment.
2. Backend runs on `:8080`, Frontend on `:3000`.
3. Database is accessible on `:5432`.
